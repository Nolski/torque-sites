# Torque Sites

Repository of open source code for
[Torque](https://github.com/opentechstrategies/torque/) sites managed
by [Open Tech Strategies, LLC](https://OpenTechStrategies.com/).

The code here is unlikely to be of general use, because it is highly
specific to the needs and datasets of OTS clients (e.g., the
[MacArthur Foundation](https://www.MacFound.org) and [Lever for
Change](https://www.leverforchange.org/)).  We release the code as
open source software anyway, because that's our usual practice and
because some of it could serve as an example or as a template for
other similar efforts, primarily for anyone deploying a Torque-based
service.
