# MacFound

Repository of open source code specific MacArthur Foundation internal
projects.

The code here is unlikely to be of general use, because it is highly
specific to the needs and datasets of the [MacArthur
Foundation](https://www.MacFound.org).  We release it as open source
anyway, because that's our usual practice and because some of it could
serve as an example or a template for other similar efforts.

Right now the things most likely to be useful in here are the
[refresh](refresh) script and how it drives [fix-csv](fix-csv) and
[csv2wiki](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/ots-tools/blob/master/csv2wiki)
to convert a CSV file to pages in a MediaWiki instance.
